## Bootstrap Modal for Output

A Bootstrap modal is used to display code output:

```html
<!-- Bootstrap Modal for Output -->
<div class="modal fade" id="outputModal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="outputModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">
  <div class="modal-dialog" role="document">
    <div class="modal-content">
      <div class="modal-header">
        <i class="fa fa-times close-icon" onclick="closeOutputModal()" style="font-size: 24px;"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body" id="outputModalBody"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
